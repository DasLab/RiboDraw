## Paper outline
### Title
RiboDraw: Semiautomated layout of RNA tertiary structure diagrams 

### Target Journal
J. Mol Graphics? RNA?

### Motivation
Semi-automated: good for human to do layout (show hand-drawing of domain III), but then becomes tedious to put into illustrator & refine. particularly noncaonical pairs. Also difficult to share.

Errors in published diagrams (Williams 16S rRNA?)
Oversights (cross-compare motifs from ribodraw and riboswitch representations).

'ribosome scale' -- more coming out.

We define file format.

for paper, layout all RNAs from deep chemical profiling study & compare to literature layouts.

### Figures
* From hand-drawn to initial ribodraw to complete refinement.  [show as flow chart]
* compare 4-6 ribodraw figures to literature examples (glycine riboswitch, tRNA, group I intron, adenosylcobalamin riboswitch puzzle, ZMP puzzle, Zika puzzle -- whatever will go into DCP paper)
* E. coli 23S and 16S rRNA figures

### Info to remember
* Talk about human choices in 'flattening structure': 
 - Example in long L11 stack (domain II) 
 - Example of difficulty of representing complete coaxial stacks in multiway junction (perhaps domain II again, or domain I central 'struct')
 - Example of T-loop intercalation
