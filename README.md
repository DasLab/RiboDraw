# RiboDraw
Pilot scripts for semiautomated layout of RNA 2D diagrams

_(C) Rhiju Das, Stanford University, 2017_


## Development Notes

* Testing on large ribosomal subunit (23S rRNA) of _E. coli_, initially on Domain III.

* May have dependencies on various functions in RiboKit.


## TODO

### To get Single-domain graphs
* Fun: show noncanonical pairs (slaved)
* proper datastructure for saving and loading
* Snap to grid
* move by residues, not by bounding rectangle

### Multidomain graphs
* bounding box domain movement
* residue colors

* show motifs
* save figure state to disk as JSON?
