# RiboDraw
Pilot scripts for semiautomated layout of RNA 2D diagrams

_(C) Rhiju Das, Stanford University, 2017_


## Development Notes

* Testing on large ribosomal subunit (23S rRNA) of _E. coli_, initially on Domain III.

* May have dependencies on various functions in RiboKit.


## TODO

### To get Single-domain graphs

* Allow horizontal & vertical flips

* Association of single residues with parent helices, default starter locations.

* allow movement of residues

* draw linker arrows between residues (slaved to residues, for now)

* update_noncanonical_pairs (slaved)

### Multidomain graphs

* bounding box domain movement


* Grid lock



* show motifs

* save figure state to disk as JSON
