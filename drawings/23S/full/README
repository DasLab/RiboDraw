# note: creating a branch of Rosetta where I can get not just motifs but also stacked base pairs, which
#  I'll feed into some MATLAB layout code

rna_motif -mute all -s 4ybb_23S_5S.pdb
# -PDB_components_file $ROSETTA/main/database/chemical/components.cif.gz

# This gave list of stems. Then added (by hand) list of names of helices to get:

cat 4ybb_23S_5S_stems.txt
cat 4ybb_23S_5S_base_pairs.txt

# Need to tell MATLAB the sequence:
pdb2fasta.py 4ybb_23S_5S.pdb  > 4ybb_23S_5S.fasta
